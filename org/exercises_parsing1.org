1. Read the specification. What are the regular expressions involved,
   and which semantic values are they associated with?

2. Generate the lexer out of the specification using a command
   prompt. Which additional file is generated during the process? How
   many states are there by the automaton of the lexer?

   Hint: You can generate the lexer with the command "dotnet fslex.dll
   --unicode myfile.fsl", in which "dotnet" is from .Net Core,
   fslex.dll should point to the path of the DLL file.  If you use MS
   Visual Studio, you may find instructions here useful:
   https://github.com/zhoulaifu/hello_fslex; you can get the number of
   the states of the automaton by reading the report output when the
   lexer is generated.

3. Draw a DFA corresponding to the lexer.

   Hint: One of the states should indicate errors.

4. Modify the lexer specification file so that it transforms a text
   with floating-point numbers to another one where all texts are the
   same except that any floating-point number, deonoted by fp, becomes
   0.1*fp.

   Hint: You may consider using [+-]?([0-9]*[.])?[0-9]+ as the regular
   expressions for floating-point numbers. This will match, for
   example, 12, 12.45, or .67. You may also use a different regular
   expression that recognizes not 12 or .67, but it must be able to
   recognize numbers with a digit in the middle, like 12.45.

5. Testing. Generate the lexer and run it with an input "hello 2.7",
   the output should be "hello 0.27".

   Run the generated lexer on a piece C++ code used in the Robot
   Operating System:
   https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/noetic-devel/turtlesim/tutorials/draw_square.cpp

   Hint: Suppose you can run your lexer with a command "mylex", then
   you can use a pipeline to get the output: "cat draw_square.cpp |
   mylex".

Your handin for this exercise should include (1) the lexer
specification file; and (2) the transfomed text from running the lexer
on draw_square.cpp.
